 <h1>Benjamin Hodgson</h1>
    <p>G'day, I'm Ben, I enjoy mountain-biking when I can, travelling, and generally, being outside.
        I also enjoy gaming when I find the time, I've competed in tournaments for the game Counter Strike.
        I'm good at critical thinking and problem solving, but also have strong interpersonal skills.
        I'll be aiming for a HD in this unit.
